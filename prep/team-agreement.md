# Team Agreement

## Cooperation

* Describe the following

  * What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
  * How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
  * In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
  * Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

* Carlos
  * strengths: adaptability, vision, and attention to detail
  * I plan to contribute as a flex position to contribute in both front and back end logic. Also, I can envision a clear path to the MVP
  * My code is not efficient, readable, or scalable. I want to improve delivering "good code"
  * daily stand-ups and mid-day meetings to discuss the progress achieved and any hiccups

* Brooke
  * strengths: flexibility, attention to detail
  * I plan to contribute by being able to adapt to the different ideas the group comes up with. I also think I can help with my debugging skills. I have good attention to detail, and I think this helps me debug code.
  * I would like to get better at writing reusable code. Sometimes I write too much code in one function or component. If I were to break up some of the code, it would be more reusable and also easier to understand.
  * Doing good stand-ups and code reviews are helpful for understanding all parts of the project

## Conflict Plan

* What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  * initially, attempt to handle the situation on a one-on-one basis. If that doesn't resolve the issue then it would require "management" involvement.
* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
  * Similar to the above scenario, attempt to handle the situation at a personal level before getting the authorities involved
* How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  * by utilizing the Trello board and individuals claiming tasks appropriate to skill level and interest
* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  * Though the team is understanding if a member is contributing less than expected, there is no room for slackers. This will be handled quickly to prevent resentment
* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  * after an initial one-on-one or intervention style discussion. Time is crucial so there is no time for skirting issues. Get them resolved immediately

## Communication plan

* What hours will you be available to communicate?
  * we will be available to communicate during working hours and up to 9pm. If the project is not complete over the weekend, then the hours are indefinite until it is complete
* What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  * slack, zoom, remo, email
* How often will you take breaks?
  * as needed, but probably every 1-1.5 hours
* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  * conduct a quick review of the Trello board and decide which features are absolutely crucial to meet MVP and shift focus and resources to meet the deadline
* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  * up to 9pm as necessary during the week, up to 5pm on the weekend if required. If the team has decided that more work is required, then working hours will be established over the weekend.
* What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  * everyone has valid opinions and is open to ask question
* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  * be aware of each other's feelings, mood, and contributions

## Work Plan

* How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  * the team agreed to make and adhere to a trello board to identify tasks and claim items. Everyone is free to choose their problem domains and ask for or give help as needed
* What project management tool will be used?
  * trello

## Git Process

* What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  * all components that make the app work, including readmes
* How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  * as an organization on GitHub
* What is your Git flow?
  * CI/CD: continuous development, commit early and often
* Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  * How many people must review a PR?
    * 2 for the dev branch and 3 for the prod branch
  * Who merges PRs?
    * last to review
  * How often will you merge?
    * at least twice a day, once before lunch and once before close. Also, at any large implementation event
  * How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
