# Project Prep 2

## Idea 1
This project is an event planning application. A venue can create an account as the venue owner, and add the different rooms available at the venue. Then event hosts can create an account and view available rooms. They can book events and create a guest list for the event. The guests can RSVP and provide their information. Once the guests RSVP, the host can use the information about the room provided by the venue (tables, maximum number of people, etc) to plan the event.

This application solves the pain point of both showcasing availability for venues, but mostly helping event planners. The application helps an event host see who has RSVPed to the event and then helps manage and seat them. By having the the information provided by venues, they can seat and preplan an event online. It also helps manage the guest list, by showing who is invited and then of those guests, who plans on attending.

MVP is having the two roles. The first role can add venues, available dates, and venue information. This is stored in a database. The second role is the event host. They can log on and see available venues. They can reserve a venue and create a guest list.

## Idea 2
The second idea is a job search app. This application uses third party APIs like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor to create a one stop shop for a job search. The app allows for user to make custom searches, save search criteria, and save jobs they like.

This application solves the pain point of having a ton of different databases for job postings and making it into one. It also allows for customization and saving data.

MVP is finding at least three third party APIs that we can pull job postings from. It also allows users to filter and sort the search results from those APIs. Users can also save search criteria and jobs in a database.
