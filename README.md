## Brief Description of Concept
Event planning website (mobile application pending) that links party planning clients and owners of venues together! Main focus of the website is to be the third party host, similar to an AirBnb, but for the event hosting market! Clients and hosts will login their specifically designed browsers where the hots can list and de-list their venues, while the clients can select and choose whatever those venues have as options.

_This repo specifically handles all information processed on the frontend_
